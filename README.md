# odin-rock-paper-scissors
Rock-Paper-Scissors javascript project
This is a project I am doing following the odin project's curriculum. I am attempting to use a prompt to gather data from the user. That data will be stored and then anylzed against a random generated descion. The outcome will be according to classic rock papers scissors rules, with three outcomes; win, lose, and draw.
